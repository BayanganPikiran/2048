# 2048

2048 was a lot of fun to build.  The final program implements the following modules/packages/libraries:

- tkinter
- random
- numpy
- os
- sys
- pickle

I have designed the entire program in the Board class.  I could have created an additional class for the gameplay,
e.g. key movement, starting, restarting, etc., but felt that would ultimately just be fancy clothes rather than effective
functionality.

In addition to standard board play and score, I've added a high score feature and a restart button.  The game is habit
forming, and I got tired of closing and restarting the program, so the restart made sense.  I could have allowed for 
gameplay to continue past reaching a tile of 2048.  Perhaps after I've actually achieved the winning 2048 I'll do so.

OK, that's it for now.  Live long and prosper.
