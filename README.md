2048 was a lot of fun to build.  The final program implements the following modules/packages/libraries:

- tkinter
- random
- numpy
- os
- sys
- pickle

I have designed the entire program in the Board class.  I could have created an additional class for the gameplay,
e.g. key movement, starting, restarting, etc., but felt that would ultimately just be fancier clothes than effective
functionality.

In addition to standard board play and score, I've added a high score feature and a restart button.  The game is habit
forming, and I got tired of closing and restarting the program, so the restart made sense.  I could have allowed for 
gameplay to continue past reaching a tile of 2048.  Perhaps after I've actually achieving the 2048 tile I'll do so.

I've looked at 2048 examples posted by finer coders than myself and let their approaches run off on me.  If someone out
there actually does this with mine, that would be fantastic.

OK, that's it for now.  Live long and prosper.
